Recently, version 0.3.1 of the site has been released. As mentioned in [this post about the new site]({{site.baseurl}}/webdevelopment/2013/11/09/new-site/) I adopted a progressive enhancement paradigm for increasing new features to the site in small steps.

With this update the following has been realized:

* All webdevelopment related posts were migrated from the old to the new site.
* The site has been refactored to repond to viewport size (it's been made "responsive"). It now uses Bootstrap with the bootstrap-xl extension for monitors over 1600px wide. The project that I used has been removed from Github, but [this is a similar solution](https://github.com/marcvannieuwenhuijzen/BootstrapXL).
* A link to my twitter feed and a proper contact form have been added, see the navigation bar on top.
* The footer has been restyled and links to my open source projects have been added.
* Some bugfixes.
