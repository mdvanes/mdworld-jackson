However, the button controller that was paired (that did not work) is not\nshowing up anymore. The Fibaro plug does show up and still works as expected.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to login with default BusyBox credentials, so after disconnecting again, taking a closer look at the\nvolume <em>scratch</em>: it contains a file <code class="language-text">@ssh/sshd_config</code> with a line <code class="language-text">PermitRootLogin yes</code>.</p>\n<p>So assuming this is the SSH config that is used runtime, we need to somehow find the root password, and then we can SSH with <code class="language-text">ssh root@192.168.0.xxx</code></p>\n<p>Following this <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1135128/what-is-default-username-and-passoword-for-busyboxs-ftpd">suggestion</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>see the /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd (if the /etc/shadow not exist) with texteditor</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found that, indeed, <code class="language-text">/etc/shadow</code> contains (values are fake):</p>\n<p><code class="language-text">root:$1$foo$bar:10933:0:99999:7:::</code></p>\n<p>So there is in fact a root entry with a hashed password visible.\nOne option would be to update the hash string with a hash string of a password that we already know, a method I used\nyears ago when adding users for a deprecated application by directly inserting lines into a database table. However,\nI have no idea what effect this would have on an OS, so I would prefer to refrain from modifying the filesystem at this\npoint. Additionally, assuming that the provided SD card image always uses the same root password, it would be valuable\nto know the password to be able to log into other devices.</p>\n<p>Another option would be to try to retrieve the password from the root entry in <code class="language-text">/etc/shadow</code>. More information about\nwhy passwords are stored in <code class="language-text">/etc/shadow</code> instead of <code class="language-text">/etc/passwd</code> <a href="https://www.slashroot.in/how-are-passwords-stored-linux-understanding-hashing-shadow-utils">here</a>.</p>\n<p>From this article I also learned how to read the shadow file: the password entry ($1$foo$bar) is in fact three\nproperties separated by $. The $1 indicates MD5 hashing was used, which is notoriously easy to crack. The second\npart ("foo") is the salt and the third part ("bar") is the hash from the password + salt.</p>\n<p>This article also shows that using the hash calculated from the salt and the password with openssl.\nThis is great, because know we can write a small script to try out many passwords without trying to login to SSH and\nbeing kicked out for too many failed responses. The command looks like this, with <code class="language-text">-1</code> indicating md5, <code class="language-text">foo</code> as the\nsalt and <code class="language-text">secret</code> the actual password.</p>\n<p><code class="language-text">openssl passwd -1 -salt foo secret # output: $1$foo$ygQElgzdVoe51UiGBN5TV/</code></p>\n<p>It is easy to do this in a bash script, but of course there already exists some open source tool: <a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a>\n(<a href="https://linuxconfig.org/password-cracking-with-john-the-ripper-on-linux">info on usage</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First run <code class="language-text">sudo unshadow rootfs/etc/passwd rootfs/etc/shadow &gt; mypasswd.txt</code>\nwhere <code class="language-text">unshadow</code> is a util from <code class="language-text">john</code>.</li>\n<li>Now remove all the entries from mypasswd.txt except the root user.</li>\n<li>Now run <code class="language-text">john mypasswd.txt --fork=4</code>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code class="language-text">fork</code> flag enables multi threading, in this case on 4 threads. While the command is running, I see that 4 out of 8 cores\nhave a 100% load. After approximately 7 hours a password is found. Please note, that the other threads keep running, but a nice overview\nis giving of how long the processes have been running and at what passwords they are trying.</p>\n<p>Logging in to SSH as root works! (So it was indeed the correct <code class="language-text">sshd_config</code>).\nA prompt is shown with only "#".
