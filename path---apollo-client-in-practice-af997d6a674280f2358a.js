This version has a built-in <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/local-state">local state manager</a>\n(formerly <em>apollo-link-state</em>) and it supports REST calls with the <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/rest">apollo-link-rest</a> plugin.\nThe <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master/packages/apollo-boost">apollo-boost</a> package contains the\nclient and several useful plugins. Adopting these means that both Redux and Axios can be removed and Apollo will be\nused as a single source of truth. If there is a single store for the data, there is no need for synchronization and\nwith that one of the issues is solved. </p>\n<p>The way we used Apollo Client was also updated, to create a better separation of UI and data. Instead of using <code class="language-text">client.query()</code>\ndirectly in the component lifecycle methods, components are split into a presentational component and enhanced with the\n<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-apollo#graphql">graphql()</a> HOC to add data from remote (i.e. GraphQL\nback-end) or local fields. Both utilize the Apollo cache, which fulfills multiple functions, one of them an application local state store.</p>\n<p>Example of wrapping a component in a Query HOC:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function">Books</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> data<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> books <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>\n  <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>ul<span class="token operator">></span>\n    <span class="token punctuation">{</span>books<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">map</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>book <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>li<span class="token operator">></span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>book<span class="token punctuation">.</span>title<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>li<span class="token operator">></span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>\n  <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>ul<span class="token operator">></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n\n<span class="token keyword">export</span> <span class="token function">graphql</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span> query<span class="token punctuation">:</span> gql<span class="token template-string"><span class="token string">`\n  query($author: String!) {\n    books(author: $author) {\n     title\n    }\n  }`</span></span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> \n  variables<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> author<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Mickiewicz"</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>Books<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Apollo reactively updates when using <code class="language-text">Query</code> as a container, basically like the <code class="language-text">connect</code> HOC in Redux. When\nthe <code class="language-text">variables</code> prop on the <code class="language-text">Query</code> component is updated, it will automatically re-query.

It also paves the way for improving the\nperformance. In general, when a lot of data enters the application, it is a good idea to format it once and cascade the\nformatted data down to the components and it\'s descendants with as little transformations to the data itself. This\nreduces the amount of computations in the lower components, which solves our other issue.</p>\n<p>When using Redux, a common way to transform data in the store is using\n<a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect">Reselect</a>, which computes derived data from the Redux store with selectors. For\nApollo this is done by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wrapping the table in a <code class="language-text">Query</code> that queries a local prop <code class="language-text">rows @client</code>, using the <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/local-state">@client</a> directive</li>\n<li>making client side resolvers for rows that queries GraphQL endpoint</li>\n<li>mapping the data in a resolver from a raw format to a format ready for the table components, e.g.:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>from a data object</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> \n  author<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Mickiewicz"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> \n  publications<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span> \n    <span class="token punctuation">{</span> \n      title<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"Pan Tadeusz"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>\n      date<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">4291747200</span> \n    <span class="token punctuation">}</span> \n  <span class="token punctuation">]</span> \n<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>to an array rows of cells</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">[</span>\n  <span class="token punctuation">[</span> <span class="token string">"Mickiewicz"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Pan Tadeusz"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"January 1834"</span> <span class="token punctuation">]</span>\n<span class="token punctuation">]</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h1 id="next-steps"><a href="#next-steps" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Next steps</h1>\n<p>Apollo is excellent for merging data from multiple sources (in this case GraphQL, REST, local state and cache) and\nfunctions as a "single source of truth" which should solve the state synchronization problems. The local fields that\nApollo uses in its local state manager can derive data, moving expensive operations from component render functions\nto resolvers in its application level cache. Although the issues mentioned in the introduction are now dealt with, we did\nencounter plenty of other issues I may dive into later. However, these are some things that you might want to\ntake into account when working with Apollo Client:</p>\n<p>Outside of restructuring the application, we improved performance with <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized">react-virtualized</a> which speeds up rendering\nlarge tables. Apollo also offers GraphQL pagination. We did not use that, as we\nhave to do our pagination on the client side to keep the sorting feature of react-virtualized in tact.</p>\n<p>Apollo Client offers support for TypeScript, it is even possible to generate queries and typed React components from\nGraphQL schemas with <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">@graphql-codegen/cli</a>.</p>\n<p>Also definitely use the <a href="https://jimkyndemeyer.github.io/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/">JS GraphQL IntelliJ Plugin</a> because\nit will not only auto complete queries, but it will help you think about (client side) schema\'s.</p>\n<p>When the <code class="language-text">Query</code> component mounts, it creates an observable that subscribes to the query in the query prop. This\nencourages reactive behavior like RxJS (which can also be used as a <a href="https://github.com/mdvanes/realtime-planner">state store</a>).\nHowever, it seems that Apollo offers much less fine-grained control over the observables than what RxJS provides. And considering observables, Apollo Client\neffortlessly <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/ws">scales to web sockets</a>!</p>\n<p>Are you looking for inspiration on how Apollo client can be applied?
